# Shopify-RelatedItems
This is a tutorial to code creating a dynamic related items section for Shopify product pages. 

This section will dynamically pull items based on a metafield value and then sort them based on their product type. 

---
### Because this project utilizes the use of metafields, you or your client will need a way to edit them. Here are three of my favorite apps that allow editing of metafields:

MetaFields Editor:
https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-editor

Bulk Import Export Update with Excel:
https://apps.shopify.com/excel-export-import

Accentuate Custom Fields:
https://apps.shopify.com/accentuate

You will find the completed code for this tutoial 

1) This code will fit entirely in a single shopify section, create a new sectino and name it RelatedItems.
